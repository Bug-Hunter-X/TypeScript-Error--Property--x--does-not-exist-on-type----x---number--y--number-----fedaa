This bug demonstrates a common error in TypeScript when dealing with optional properties.  The function `printCoord` expects an object with properties `x` and `y`. However, if the object passed to the function is missing the `x` property, TypeScript will throw an error because it cannot guarantee that `pt.x` will exist. The solution shows how to address this issue using optional chaining or type guards.
